## Description
Welcome to my React Portfolio project! This polished and dynamic single-page application meets all the requirements outlined for employers to review a developer's portfolio. Upon opening the application,  you'll find a neatly organized layout, featuring a header with my name and navigation tabs for easy exploration. The navigation highlights the current section, including "About Me," "Portfolio," "Contact," and "Resume," as per the specifications. Each section provides relevant information, from a short bio and recent photo in "About Me" to titled images linking to deployed applications and GitHub repositories in the "Portfolio" section. The "Contact" section offers a user-friendly form with field validations, ensuring seamless communication, while the "Resume" section presents a downloadable resume and proficiency list. With its intuitive design and adherence to the acceptance criteria, this React Portfolio showcases developer's expertise and dedication to modern web development.
